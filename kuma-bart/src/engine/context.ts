 * their VRAM at the OS/driver level (not JS GC). Measured: the bunny model has 506 MB of
 * unique intermediate buffers, 61 of which exceed 1 MB; pooling all of them at depth 3
 * reserved ~1.5 GB of VRAM on load and OOM'd on any device without dedicated VRAM.

 * the GC-pause fix for the ~210 small/medium buffers it was actually needed for.
 *
 * Depth 2 (down from 3): saves 33% of steady-state pool VRAM and one in-flight frame
 * slot. On memory-constrained devices (Chromebooks, integrated-GPU laptops) that can't
 * sustain 60fps anyway, the extra pipelining slot was not providing measurable throughput
 * benefit. KumaPlayer's MAX_IN_FLIGHT derives from this directly.
