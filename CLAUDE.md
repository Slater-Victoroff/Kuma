# Kuma

PyTorch `torch.export` → `.iph` compiler/exporter (Step 1 of a Torch→WebGPU compiler).

Kuma captures a PyTorch inference graph, packs its weights, and bundles everything into a
self-contained `.iph` package (a zip: `manifest.json`, `weights.f32.bin`, `kernels/*.wgsl`,
`debug_report.md`). Kuma itself is not a runtime, not a training library, and not a WebGPU
framework — the `.iph` file is the contract between this compiler and `kuma-bart`, the WebGPU
runtime that executes it. `kuma-bart/` lives in this same repo (own README at
`kuma-bart/README.md`) — this file (`CLAUDE.md`) covers the Python compiler; see
"kuma-bart (WebGPU runtime)" below for its environment/test/demo commands.

## Environment

**There is no local Python or pip on this machine.**
All Python execution, testing, and validation must happen inside Docker.

```bash
# Build image
docker compose build

# Run the acceptance test (simple model export → artifacts/simple.iph + artifacts/simple/)
docker compose run --rm export

# Run the full test suite
docker compose run --rm test

# Run a specific test file
docker compose run --rm test tests/test_convnext_block.py -v

# Or build+run in one shot
docker compose up --build
```

Artifacts land in `./artifacts/` (bind-mounted at `/workspace/artifacts` in the container).

## Testing a code change

1. Run the test suite first:
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm test
   ```

2. Then do a manual acceptance run to read the artifacts:
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm export \
     --out /workspace/artifacts/simple.iph \
     --out-dir /workspace/artifacts/simple
   ```

Spot-check the output:
- `artifacts/simple.iph` — the self-contained package (zip); should contain `manifest.json`,
  `weights.f32.bin`, `kernels/*.wgsl`, `debug_report.md`
- `artifacts/simple/debug_report.md` — ops table, weight table, warnings (no WebGPU-readiness
  guessing here — kuma-bart's own `opRegistry` is the authoritative answer to "is this op
  supported," not a static list in the compiler; see `kuma-bart/README.md`)
- `artifacts/simple/manifest.json` — full bundle descriptor; `byte_offset + byte_length` must be consistent
- `artifacts/simple/weights.f32.bin` — size should match sum of `byte_length` fields in manifest
- `artifacts/simple/exported_graph.json` — raw FX node list with `weight_name` on parameter placeholders (debug-dir only; not part of the `.iph` contract since the manifest already embeds the graph)

## kuma-bart (WebGPU runtime)

`kuma-bart/` is the TypeScript/WebGPU runtime that actually executes a `.iph` package —
full architecture, design rationale, and usage docs are in `kuma-bart/README.md`, not
duplicated here. Same environment situation as the Python side applies on some dev
boxes: no usable local Node (system Node can be too old for vite/vitest) and no Docker
group permissions either, so check which one actually works in your environment before
assuming a command below will run as-is.

```bash
# From repo root -- typecheck + vitest
docker compose run --rm bart-test

# From repo root -- serves the interactive demo at localhost:5173, bind-mounting this
# repo's artifacts/ (read-only) at demo/artifacts/ -- the same place `export` writes to
docker compose up bart-demo
```

The demo's default `.iph` path field expects something under `/artifacts/...` — run
`docker compose run --rm export` first (or point it at any other `.iph` already in
`./artifacts/`) before loading it in the demo.

## Using with a real Niko/Nika model (from another container)

The cleanest integration is to mount this repo into the model container and pip-install it there.

**Option A — bind mount + editable install (recommended for dev):**

In your model repo's `docker-compose.yml`, add:
```yaml
volumes:
  - /home/sl8rv/Projects/Kuma:/kuma
```
Then inside that container (e.g. in an entrypoint or interactively):
```bash
pip install -e /kuma
```

**Option B — install from git (for CI or fixed snapshots):**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourorg/kuma.git
```

**Direct Python API (the only entry point — there is no CLI):**

```python
import torch
import kuma

model = build_model(cfg)
model.eval()
example_inputs = (torch.randn(1, 3, 512, 512),)

kuma.export_model(model, example_inputs, out="model.iph")
```

or, starting from an already-captured `ExportedProgram`:

```python
ep = torch.export.export(model.eval(), example_inputs)
kuma.export_exported_program(ep, out="model.iph")
```

or, for lower-level access to the in-memory package before writing it out:

```python
package = kuma.compile(ep)
package.save("model.iph")        # self-contained .iph zip
package.write_dir("debug/")      # loose files for inspection
```

**Wiring up an existing model repo:**

Write a thin `export.py` alongside your model code that calls the API directly:
```python
# mymodel/export.py
import torch
import kuma
from mymodel.build import build_model   # your existing factory

model = build_model(cfg)                # fill in your config however you do it
model.eval()
example_inputs = (torch.randn(1, 3, 512, 512),)  # match the exact input shape/dtype your model expects

kuma.export_model(model, example_inputs, out="artifacts/mymodel.iph")
```

## Key constraints (Step 1 scope)

- Inference only, static shapes, float32 only.
- `torch.export.export` is the primary capture path.
- WGSL kernels are embedded in every `.iph` package, and `kuma-bart` does execute them now
  — but there's still no kernel fusion or general memory/buffer planning anywhere in the
  pipeline (the `.iph` format itself doesn't carry what a real planner would need yet).
- Fail loudly on unsupported dtypes, non-CPU tensors, or dynamic shapes.
- Target models: Conv/ConvNeXt/operator/decoder style (Niko/Nika family).

## What's next (Step 2+)

`kuma-bart` (this repo's WebGPU interpreter) already exists and runs `.iph` packages —
see its own README for current status. What's still genuinely ahead, split across both
halves of the pipeline:

- Op decompositions and ATen → WebGPU op lowering beyond the current kernel set
- A real buffer/memory planner and a general kernel-fusion pass (today: a fixed-depth
  buffer-reuse pool and a few hand-specialized kernels in kuma-bart, not a planner) —
  needs the `.iph` format itself to start carrying information (live ranges, fusable
  subgraphs) it doesn't emit yet, so this is compiler-side work as much as runtime-side
